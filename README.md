# Vision-46
Overview
ViSiON-46 is an accessibility-focused web application designed to assist visually impaired users by leveraging advanced machine learning models and voice-command navigation. The project integrates multiple technologies to provide real-time object detection, text recognition, and an intuitive hands-free browsing experience.

# Features  
- **Real-time Object Detection** – Utilizes COCO-SSD (TensorFlow.js) to identify and label objects in real time, helping users understand their surroundings.  
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** – Implements Tesseract.js for detecting and extracting text from images, making printed or digital text accessible through audio feedback.  
- **Voice Command Navigation** – Designed an interactive voice-controlled interface that enables users to navigate the application effortlessly, reducing dependency on traditional input methods.  
- **Cross-browser Compatibility** – Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JS libraries to ensure smooth functionality across different browsers and devices.  

### Technologies Used  
- **TensorFlow.js** – Machine learning framework for object detection.  
- **Tesseract.js** – OCR engine for text recognition.  
- **JavaScript & JS Libraries** – Core development framework.  
- **HTML & CSS** – Structured UI for accessibility and responsiveness.  

### Future Improvements  
- Enhance object detection accuracy with custom-trained models.  
- Expand text-to-speech capabilities for multi-language support.  
- Implement AI-powered scene description for better contextual awareness.
